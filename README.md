1.	How do I approach designing software?

o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

  During this project the skills I’ve crafted are troubleshooting proper file usage and manipulating objects in 3D space.  Prior to this course I had not fully grasped the concept of how the different files worked congruently together when utilizing OpenGL.  On top of that, seeing how the meshes work and generate objects using triangles to create the objects.
  
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?

The design process I followed with this project was an incremental implementation process.  I would implement different portions of the project and then test them and ensure they worked together.  I used a lot of the example code to adapt to my own project as well.
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think the incremental implementation process and adapting other work to current and future projects is a pretty common practice in programming so I will continue to refine this practice until I’m able to start generating programs on my own.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?

o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?


I didn’t develop any new strategies when working on this scene, like I said above I just used an incremental process and tested things as I went to see if I got the result I was looking for.

o	How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration factored into my development as a primary process for developing the program, I would make small adjustments to the objects as I made them to ensure they were properly sized, positioned, and textured.

o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

My approach alone to developing code didn’t really change throughout the milestones.  What changed the most was my understanding of how the different files interacted with the overall program.  Knowing which portion of the files changed what in the program became very simple to understand by the end of the project.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Computational graphics and visualization refined my knowledge how different files work within a program and how things could be adapted for other programs into what my current goal was.

o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I don’t there was anything directly from computational graphics and visualization gave me any new knowledge to be applied in my future professional pathway for the simple fact that most professions are seeking security knowledge and networking.  I think most graphic design is going to be taken over by development companies developing large language models to create scenes quicker and more efficiently than a team of developers could do it.
